**A New Method for the Exploitation of Speech Recognition Systems**  
[*Paper*](https://bit.ly/2qA28Sn) [*Slides*](https://bit.ly/2ELUk5g) [*Code Sample*](https://github.com/suhacker1/phonetic-classification)    
I determined how to hack a speech recognition system, specifically a neural network for phonetic classification, using adversarial machine learning. I developed an algorithm and tested it using 2 neural networks and the TIMIT data set. My research was conducted at NYU CCS under Professor Ramesh Karri and Zahra Ghodsi.  
_Areas_: Cybersecurity, Deep Learning (Adversarial Machine Learning)  
_Skills_: TensorFlow, SSH, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook, Python 2.7, Technical Writing, Engineering Research  
_Awards_: Intel ISEF Second Award in Systems Software, Shanghai STEM Cloud Award, National Security Agency Research Directorate Second “Science Security” Award,  GoDaddy Data Award, Association for Computing Machinery Fourth Award, Intel ISEF Finalist, Naval Science Award, NYCSEF First Award in Computer Science, Sarah & Morris Wiesenthal Award

**Conveyor Belt**  
[*Code Sample*](https://github.com/suhacker1/Arduino-Code-for-Stepper-Motor-Control-)  
I designed and developed a prototype conveyor belt system for a new product at Vengo Labs. The system consisted of an Arduino, a stepper motor driver chip, and a stepper motor in addition to other mechanical parts.    
_Areas_: Mechanical Engineering, Hardware(Electrical) Engineering, Rapid Prototyping    
_Skills_: EaglePCB, Arduino, CATIA, Hand Tools    

**Math Research Repository**
[*Code Sample*](https://github.com/jchen42703/MathResearchQHSS)  
In collaboration with Jospeh Chen, I developed procedures for statistics and machine learning for math research. 
_Areas_: Nonparametric Statistics, Machine Learning, Microeconomics, Bayesian Analysis  
_Skills_: Python, Sci-kit Learn, Keras, Technical Writing, Scipy, Matplotlib

**The Effect of Neural Network Architecture on Quadcopter Control Systems Performance**    
I tested the performance of several PID controllers that included neural networks (and one standard one), and then conducted the Chi-Square GOF test to ascertain dependence.  
_Skills_: Matlab, Simulink, Statistical Analysis, Technical Writing, Engineering Research
