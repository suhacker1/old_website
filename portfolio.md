**A New Method for the Exploitation of Speech Recognition Systems**  
[*Paper*](https://bit.ly/2qA28Sn) [*Slides*](https://bit.ly/2ELUk5g) [*Code Sample*](https://github.com/alc0rh/phonetic-classification)    
I determined how to hack a speech recognition system, specifically a neural network for phonetic classification, using adversarial machine learning. I developed an algorithm and tested it using 2 neural networks and the TIMIT data set. My research was conducted at NYU CCS under Professor Ramesh Karri and Zahra Ghodsi.

**Conveyor Belt**  
[*Code Sample*](https://github.com/alc0rh/Arduino-Code-for-Stepper-Motor-Control-)  
I designed and developed a prototype conveyor belt system for a new product at Vengo Labs. The system consisted of an Arduino, a stepper motor driver chip, and a stepper motor in addition to other mechanical parts.    
_Areas_: Mechanical Engineering, Hardware(Electrical) Engineering, Rapid Prototyping    
_Skills_: EaglePCB, Arduino, CATIA, Hand Tools    

**(working title)--** (in-progress)  
_Areas_: Cybersecurity, Hardware Development, Machine Learning, Software Engineering & App Development
_Skills_: Android NDK, SnapDragon Profiler, Android SDK, BASH, Command Line Utilities, Python, Sci-kit Learn, Keras, Technical Writing, Engineering Research
I am conducting this research at NYU CCS. 

**The Effect of Neural Network Architecture on Quadcopter Control Systems Performance**    
I tested the performance of several PID controllers that included neural networks (and one standard one), and then conducted the Chi-Square GOF test to ascertain dependence.  
_Skills_: Matlab, Simulink, Statistical Analysis, Technical Writing, Engineering Research
