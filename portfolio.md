**A New Method for the Exploitation of Speech Recognition Systems**  
[*Paper*](https://bit.ly/2qA28Sn) [*Slides*](https://bit.ly/2ELUk5g) [*Code Sample*](https://github.com/alc0rh/phonetic-classification)    
I determined how to hack a speech recognition system, specifically a neural network for phonetic classification, using adversarial machine learning. I developed an algorithm and tested it using 2 neural networks and the TIMIT data set. My research was conducted at NYU CCS under Professor Ramesh Karri and Zahra Ghodsi.

**Conveyor Belt**  
[*Code Sample*](https://github.com/alc0rh/Arduino-Code-for-Stepper-Motor-Control-)  
I designed and developed a prototype conveyor belt system for a new product at Vengo Labs. The system consisted of an Arduino, a stepper motor driver chip, and a stepper motor in addition to other mechanical parts.
