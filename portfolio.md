**A New Method for the Exploitation of Speech Recognition Systems**  

[*Paper*](https://bit.ly/2qA28Sn) + [*Slides*](https://bit.ly/2ELUk5g) + [*Code Sample*](https://github.com/suhacker1/phonetic-classification)    

I determined how to hack a speech recognition system, specifically a neural network for phonetic classification, using adversarial machine learning. I developed an algorithm and tested it using 2 neural networks and the TIMIT data set. My research was conducted at NYU CCS under Professor Ramesh Karri and Zahra Ghodsi.  

_Areas_: Cybersecurity, Deep Learning (Adversarial Machine Learning)

**Conveyor Belt**  

[*Code Sample*](https://github.com/suhacker1/Arduino-Code-for-Stepper-Motor-Control-)  

I designed and developed a prototype conveyor belt system for a new product at Vengo Labs. The system consisted of an Arduino, a stepper motor driver chip, and a stepper motor in addition to other mechanical parts.    

_Areas_: Mechanical Engineering, Hardware(Electrical) Engineering, Rapid Prototyping    

_Skills_: EaglePCB, Arduino, CATIA, Hand Tools    

**Math Research Repository**

[*Code*](https://github.com/jchen42703/MathResearchQHSS)  

In collaboration with Jospeh Chen, I developed procedures for statistics and machine learning for math research. 

_Areas_: Nonparametric Statistics, Machine Learning, Microeconomics, Bayesian Analysis  

_Skills_: Python, Sci-kit Learn, Keras, Technical Writing, Scipy, Matplotlib
