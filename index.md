My name is Suha Sabi Hussain. Welcome to my site!

I’m a student, a hacker, an engineer, a researcher, and a writer living in New York City. Originally from Brooklyn, I believe in working at the intersection of engineering and art/media to spark change. Expanding the limits of human progress and making the universe a safer place is what I want to do with my life.

I specialize in cyber security, hardware development, and artificial intelligence. I’m learning more about decentralized applications, data science, and mixed reality in addition to economics, design, and government.

I run several organizations at [my school](http://www.qhss.org/) (QHSS Robotics, Team Cyber, STEMinism) and am actively involved in ARISTA, Urban Sketchers, and Math Research. Having conducted independent research previously, I’m currently interning at the [NYU Center for Cybersecurity](http://cyber.nyu.edu/); my research has won several awards, including the second award in systems software at the Intel ISEF 2018. I’ve also worked at a tech startup called Vengo Labs and participated in multiple competitions, including the Science Bowl.

Writing is one of my favorite passions. I’m experienced with a wide variety of forms, including research papers, technical documentation, prose, and screenwriting. I have a screenplay in progress: Always Anonymous.
