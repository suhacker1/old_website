My name is Suha Sabi Hussain. Welcome to my site!

I’m a researcher, engineer, and student in New York City. 

I primarily conduct research in machine learning and cybersecurity, and I greatly enjoy hardware development. For example, I’ve worked on hacking speech recognition systems and building conveyor belts. My current position is an intern at the [NYU Center for Cybersecurity](http://cyber.nyu.edu/). I’ve also freelanced and interned at [Vengo Labs](https://vengolabs.com/). 

As a senior at [Queens High School for the Sciences](http://www.qhss.org/), I run or help run multiple organizations, namely QHSS Robotics, Team Cyber & The Da Vinci Experiment, and Math Research. I partake in ARISTA and Urban Sketchers activities. Many of these roles capitalize upon my predilection for teaching and training. I’ve also studied mathematical modeling at Google’s igniteCS Bootcamp at Columbia University. 

My other interests and hobbies include art (modern art in particular), writing (prose, screenplays, technical writing), ring theory, cognitive science, political science, and economics.
