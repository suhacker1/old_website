[31m-            <p class="lead"> Originally from New York City, Iâ€™m a computer science major (with concentrations in machine learning and human-centered computing) involved in research and RoboJackets (among other activities) at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. My experience revolves around machine learning security and privacy research with exposure to hardware, systems, and mobile development. </p>[m
[31m-            <p class="lead"> I want to build software and devices that can truly help people. Iâ€™m primarily interested in solving interdisciplinary, real-world problems through machine learning, cybersecurity, data science, and human-computer interaction. Some of my other interests include science fiction, writing, 3D printing, statistics, critical theory, STS,  boxing, and entrepreneurship.  </p>[m
[31m-            <p class="lead"> Iâ€™m excited to apply my skills to new problems and areas whether itâ€™s brain-computer interfaces or urban growth. Contact me at the emails listed below for any inquiries, and make sure to check out the rest of my website for more information. </p>[m
[32m+[m[32m            <p class="lead"> Iâ€™m a native New Yorker pursuing a BS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech with threads in People and Intelligence. Iâ€™m currently developing software for autonomous vehicles at RoboJackets and conducting research at Georgia Techâ€™s Institute for Information Security and Privacy (IISP). Iâ€™ll be a security engineering intern at Trail of Bits this winter break.  </p>[m
